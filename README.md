# customer-segementation
This project focuses on using unsupervised machine learning to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior, utilizing the Mall Customers Dataset. The goal is to uncover distinct customer groups that can help businesses make better decisions in marketing, customer engagement, and resource allocation.

The dataset used includes features such as Age, Annual Income, and Spending Score. KMeans clustering is applied to group customers into meaningful clusters. Before clustering, the data is preprocessed and scaled. The Elbow Method is used to determine the optimal number of clusters, and the final clusters are visualized in two dimensions to better understand the characteristics of each group.

The project is implemented in Python using libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn for modeling, and Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization.
